# The Grumpy Mentor's GSoC FAQ #

This is an intentionally snarky guide to GSoC Frequently Asked Questions.  If you're looking for serious answers, please read the  [Official GSoC FAQ](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2015/help_page).


## "How do I choose an organization/project for GSoC?  I don't care what I work on.  Help!" ##

**Snarky Answers**
  1. Telling org admins and mentors you don't care about them or their projects is a **great** way to make a first impression.  You should keep saying this, repeatedly, until someone admires your incredible [Tabula Rasa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa) brain and takes you under their wing.
  1. If you can't choose a project yourself, you're not mature enough for Google Summer of Code.  Come back when you're ready.
  1. You should work on the MDO project to make a spinner that chooses projects for you!

**Explanatory Answers**
  1. Many mentors have found that the most successful students are the ones who are passionate about their organization or the specific code project, because they're the ones who are more willing to push through if things get difficult, or willing to do research on the best solutions for a problem and make decisions based on what they learn.  So while we understand that the number of organizations and projects can be overwhelming, you really aren't doing yourselves any favours by asking this question.
  1. Spend some time thinking about your own interests.  Is there a programming language you prefer?  Is there an open source project that you use and like?  One that you use and wish was better?  Is there a scientific or social cause you'd like to contribute your skills towards?   Is there a mentor you particularly want to work with?  Is there an open source developer whose work you particularly admire?  If you're really not sure, roll a die or use a random number generator to choose a few organizations and projects to investigate and see if you find any that interest you.  Once you've narrowed it down, it's much easier for mentors to guide you to something suitable for your skills.

## Can I ask you a question? ##

**Snarky Answers**
  1. No
  1. I think you just did.
  1. Don't ask to ask... just ask.

**Explanatory Answers**
  1. Don't ask if it's ok to ask a question rather than just stating your question directly.  While it might be polite to do so in some in-person situations, it's considered a waste of time or even rude on IRC, where mentors are often multi-tasking.  Asking to ask means they get interrupted in their workflow twice, whereas just asking the question directly means they only get interrupted once.  State your question outright and don't forget to stay online for an answer!
